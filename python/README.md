# Python Samples

This section contains a collection of samples that demonstrate various serverless use cases using Python.

Python is a great choice for building serverless applications that require data processing, machine learning, and web applications.

## Samples

### Getting Started

- [Hello World](./hello-world/README.md): A simple Python function that returns a message.
- [Environment Variables](./environment-variables/README.md): Demonstrates how to use environment variables in a serverless function.
- [Execution Timeout](./execution-timeout/README.md): Blueprint to delay request execution using timeouts.
- [HTTP Method Identifier](./http-method-identifier/README.md): Blueprint to identify the HTTP method used in the request.
- [HTTP Modify Header](./http-modify-header/README.md): Blueprint for modifying response header implemented in Python.
- [HTTP Redirect](./http-redirect/README.md): Blueprint for returning HTTP redirect implemented in Python.

### External Integrations

- [OpenAI Prompt](./openai-prompt/README.md): Integration with OpenAI's GPT API for generating conversational responses.
- [HTTP Connection Pooling](./http-connection-pooling/README.md): Demonstrates how to recycle HTTP connections using HTTP connection pools.

### IT Automations

- [External Process](./external-process/README.md): Demonstrates running an external process using the Python subprocess module.
- [DNS Stats](./dns-stats/README.md): Blueprint program to get DNS stats for the given domain.
