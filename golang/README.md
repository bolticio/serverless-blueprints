# Golang Samples

This section contains a collection of samples that demonstrate various serverless use cases using Golang.

Golang is a great fit for building serverless applications because it compiles to a single binary, produces a small serverless deployment unit, efficient in resource usage, and has the ability to manage memory allocation out-of-the-box.
