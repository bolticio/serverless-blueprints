# Golang Samples

This section contains a collection of samples that demonstrate various serverless use cases using Golang.

Golang is a great fit for building serverless applications because it compiles to a single binary, produces a small serverless deployment unit, efficient in resource usage, and has the ability to manage memory allocation out-of-the-box.

## Samples

### Getting Started

- [Hello World](./hello-world/README.md): A simple Python function that returns a message.
- [Environment Variables](./environment-variables/README.md): Demonstrates how to use environment variables in a serverless function.
- [Execution Timeout](./execution-timeout/README.md): Blueprint to delay request execution using timeouts.
- [HTTP Modify Header](./http-modify-header/README.md): Blueprint for modifying response header implemented in Python.
- [HTTP Redirect](./http-redirect/README.md): Blueprint for returning HTTP redirect implemented in Python.
- [HTTP CORS](./http-cors/README.md): Shows how to make CORS-enabled requests with serverless function.

### IT Automations

- [External Process](./external-process/README.md): Demonstrates running an external process using the Python subprocess module.
- [Statelessness](./statelessness/README.md): An example of what variable state function instances do (and don't) store.
